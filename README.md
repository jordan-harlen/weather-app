# Weather App

A simple weather app that uses the OpenWeather API to display the current weather information for a given location.

I made this as a way to practice my skills with the involved technologies and to further explorer whether or not Tailwind CSS was for me or not.
As well as a way to improve my skills in CSS.

Currently there is a button for your current location but there has been no logic added to it yet. It is something I would like to implement in the future.
